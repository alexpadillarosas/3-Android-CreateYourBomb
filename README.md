# Android-CreateYourBomb
This Android project shows a way to pass Java objects between activities using Intents.

User Interface controls used:
    ConstraintLayout
    TextView
    EditText
    ImageView
    Switch
    

At this point in the subject, there is a room for improvement. The current project has a lot of warnings we will fix in the next classes.
