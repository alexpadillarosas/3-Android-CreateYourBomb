# Android-CreateYourBomb
This Android project shows a way to pass Java objects between activities using Intents.

Notice that to pass the object in this app, the object must implement the interface Serializable.

## User Interface controls used:
    ConstraintLayout
    TextView
    EditText
    ImageView
    Switch
    

At this point in the subject, there is a room for improvement. The current project has a lot of warnings we will fix in the following classes.

## First Activity

## Update
A button to select the name from the phone contacts database was added.
### Important : if you are testing it on an emulator, add contacts first:
Jim Morrison and Lady Gaga were previously added as contacts in the emulator, so we can select one.
